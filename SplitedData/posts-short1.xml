Short of hardcore stuff like replacing the entire server, or replacing the RAID hardware, we were getting desperate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I first got the server, I had a problem where drive bay #6 wasn't recognized. Switching out hard drives to a different brand, strangely, fixed this -- and updating the RAID BIOS (for the first of many times) fixed it permanently, so I was able to use the original &quot;incompatible&quot; drive in bay 6. On a hunch, I began to assume that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136143&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Western Digital SATA hard drives&lt;/a&gt; I chose  were somehow incompatible with the ServeRAID 8k controller.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Buying 6 new hard drives was one of the cheaper options on the table, so I went for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822145215&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;6 Hitachi (aka IBM, aka Lenovo) hard drives&lt;/a&gt; under the theory that an IBM/Lenovo RAID controller is more likely to work with the drives it's typically sold with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looks like that hunch paid off -- we've been through three of our heaviest load days (mon,tue,wed) without a single I/O error of any kind. Prior to this we regularly had at least one I/O &quot;event&quot; in this time frame. &lt;strong&gt;It sure looks like switching brands of hard drive has fixed our intermittent RAID I/O problems!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I understand that IBM/Lenovo probably tests their RAID controller exclusively with their own brand of hard drives, I'm disturbed that a RAID controller would have such subtle I/O problems with particular brands of hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my question is, &lt;strong&gt;is this sort of SATA drive incompatibility common with RAID controllers?&lt;/strong&gt; Are there some brands of drives that work better than others, or are &quot;validated&quot; against particular RAID controller?
